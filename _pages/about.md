I'm currently a Master's degree student (from September 2024) at the [School of Computer Science](https://cs.fudan.edu.cn/) of [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/) and a member of the [DASLab](https://daslab.fudan.edu.cn/), advised by Associate Prof. [Kai Zhang](https://kay21s.github.io/). Previously, I got my bachelor's degree in June 2024 from Fudan University, advised by Associate Prof. [Kai Zhang](https://kay21s.github.io/).

My research focused on **Vector Search** and **Vector Databases**. Feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:lyhe20@fudan.edu.cn)
